        <p>Between 2012 and 2018, the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs saw a steady stream of budget increases. This led to a continued increase in the amount of program funding awarded to cultural institutions across New York City—a
          total increase of approximately 30% over the course of six years.</p>

        <p>The Bronx Council on the Arts, a multidisciplinary grantmaking institution, saw their awards from the Department of Cultural Affairs increase by approximately 30% over the six year period, which allowed them to distribute more grants to
          artists and organizations located in the Bronx and to spearhead four different grantmaking initiatives.</p>

        <p>“It was great, but you can always use more,” says Executive Director of the Bronx Council on the Arts Viviana Bianchi.</p>

        <p>Organizations that saw the greatest increase in funding were folk arts, visual arts & photography and literature; funding for folk arts organizations doubled during the six years.</p>
